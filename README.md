# ~~PSYCH 60122~~BIOL 62152 MVPA/RSA Practical Demos

This repository contains code written to help guide us through the application of the [RSA Toolbox](http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/methods-and-resources/toolboxes/).
In addition to the code in this repository, you will need to RSA Toolbox itself (in the `rsatoolbox` folder) and the pre-computed information maps for the searchlight demo (in the `DEMO4` directory).

The `PSYCH_60122_MVPA_RSA_master` directory should be waiting for you on the share drive, and the `DEMO4` and `rsatoolbox` directories should be within it. Copy `PSYCH_60122_MVPA_RSA_master` into `C:\Work` on your lab computer.

What you should see is:

```

Where the starred items are those not directly distributed in this repository. If they are not there, look up a level in the shared drive and copy them in to your working directory.
